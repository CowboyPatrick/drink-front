# drink-front
## About
A VUE front-end for a rails back-end API that I created.  This app will be able to access a log of the drinks.  I created this to try using the VUE framework for the first time and to learn how to access my own API.

# TODO
* [ ] Create new drinks
* [ ] Add review to drinks

* [ ] authorize user
